Yo, I'm Eduardo Paix√£o, also known as "darccau". I am currently an IT student
at Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte, focusing on cyber security and
computer networks.

I am also formed as a network technician, this allowed me to work with network
infrastructure at [STI](https://info.ufrn.br/) performing N1 support and
solving network tasks. I currently work at the same company, but now at the
[Security Incident Response and Treatment Center](https://cetris.ufrn.br/)
where I perform offensive security tests, infraestructure impruvement and
creating tools. I am also a volunteer member of the Cyberdef lab, where I work
solving cybersecurity issues at my college.

Majority of my software projects are open, you can see them on my
[github](https://github.com/darccau/).

If you want contact me, i have my e-mail and twitter links at the [home
page](https://darccau.github.io)
